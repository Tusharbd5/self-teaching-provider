                    <p className='fs-5' style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                        The key differences between authentication and authorization is authentication is the system to identify the user is logged in or not and the authorization is the system to access of the logged in user. If i tell more easily then if i am unknown for the website then i have to sign in or logged-in for visiting some secured page for authentication system. After log-in i need to access the server sites information. But it is defined that which files or data or elements should accessible for me by the authorization system.

                    <h4><span className='fw-bold'>Question: </span> Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?</h4>
                    <p className='fs-5' style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
                        Usually i am using firebase for authenticate my users sign-in or log-in to my website. If any user want to access some secured page of my website then for their validation i need to authenticate them for that reason i am using firebase authentication. <br /> <br />

                        There are some other options of firebase alternative authentication. But all of them firebase is the best option. The alternatives of firebase are given below-
